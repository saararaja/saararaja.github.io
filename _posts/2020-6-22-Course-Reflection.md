title: Course Reflection
---

Thus far, this course has been a great intro to R.  I felt like the pace has been appropriate and the homework assignments have been valuable.  I am personally learning a lot, though I have found myself struggling mainly with time management balancing work and two courses on a shortened summer schedule.  I feel like I could definitely benefit from having more time with the content from this course, but other than timeline I have been doing well.

Now that we know the basics of R, I am interested more in how to *think* as a Data Scientist.  I just completed the linear regression homework, and I tried many iterations of models, but did not seem to make a significant improvement in performance.  I think understanding how to begin the data exploration process to get hints in the right direction would be a very useful skill to learn.
