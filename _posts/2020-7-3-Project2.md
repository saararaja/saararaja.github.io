Here is a link to my project: [project](https://saararaja.github.io/ST558--Project-2/)

This project was definitely interesting, yet a big challenge.  By far, the most difficult part is figuring out how to do variable selection in the best possible way in order to be on the right track for model selection.
None of the models that I came up with had a particularly great fit for predicting shares, and I kept second-guessing myself, whether there is a different methodology for variable selection that I should be employing.  The actual coding part of creating and testing models is easy enough, but I need a lot of work in understanding the mindset of how to begin data exploration, find leads, and choose variables appropriately.

If I were to do this project again, I would try different methods of variable selection for the linear regression method, such as backward selection.  I used all of the variables first and then removed all of the ones that were not statistically significant. I would like to know if there is a way that can get better model performance.

I enjoyed learning about the parameter automation, so that was probably my biggest takeaway from this project.  There were several missteps I made, such as not realizing that the `render()` function needs to be run from a separate .R file instead of within the same .Rmd file.  It took a while to research those errors, but I definitely learned a lot.
