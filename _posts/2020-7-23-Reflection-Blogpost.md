From the beginning of the course till now, my impression of what it means to be a data scientist have stayed consistent given that I work in the field.  However, I work in just one particular business domain, and it has been interesting to learn a general set of tools that can be utilized in any business domain for this field.

R has been wonderfully easy to learn and work with for data science.  I particularly loved the practice of chaining `%>%` via the tidyverse, which allows you to make so many data changes without having to save intermediate data sets or writing complicated nested functions.  I also really appreciated the consistency even between different packages, where all of the machine learning models we learned thus far have similar syntax and a common `predict()` function.

I will definitely use R again for Data Science if given the opportunity at a job.  My current job uses python, but if any future R-based opportunities present themselves, I wouldn't mind taking them at all.  Sometimes I do wonder whether it is best to pick one of the two languages (R or python) and specialize in them 100% rather than knowing both at a surface level.  I am honestly not sure which is preferred, since I've seen both being used quite ubiquitously in the field.  Since I am early in my career, I will probably just keep learning both until my next job dictates which to concentrate on.

Now that I've had this course, I understand a lot more of the statistical background and coding necessary to build various models.  Up until now, I have held more of a business role in which I have liasoned between the Data Scientists and non-technical business people.  Now, I feel more confident in participating in the technical projects myself, and helping with data exploration and modeling.

Thanks for a great semester Dr. Post!
