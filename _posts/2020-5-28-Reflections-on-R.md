title: Reflections on R
---

**Prompt**: Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites).  What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  What functionality do you like about R?  What parts do you miss about your other language?  Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)

I am learning R for the first time in this course, and so far it seems very intuitive.  Previously, from either coursework or on the job, I have learned python, MATLAB, SAS, and SQL.  The syntax of R is slightly different for each of these languages, and it is taking me some time to sort out in my head which syntax belongs with which language, but other than that slight hiccouph, R has been very easy to learn.  I like that the syntax is so consistent, which makes it easy to add new functions to my toolbox.  I mainly use python in my data science work, but R seems to actually be easier to use for that specific application.

I also really like the R Markdown functionality.  At work, I use jupyter notebooks for python. But it is really nice to learn how to create interactive html webpages and pdfs with ease.  I am curious to learn whether there is even more customization that we can learn with the markdown text, to change fonts and colors.

The one thing that I feel is not *quite as* easy to do in R is data exploration. Don't get me wrong, it does have a lot of great functions in the tidyverse, but I don't think anything beats SQL languages when it comes to quick and dirty queries on various data attributes.  I think there is a reason that there are SQL modules for python and there is `PROC SQL` for SAS.  I am sure there are similar modules for R, and I am curious to learn more.
